# Deposit_Predictive_Model
<p>The investment and portfolio department would want to be able to identify their customers who potentially would subscribe to their term
deposits. As there has been heightened interest of marketing managers to carefully tune
their directed campaigns to the rigorous selection of contacts, the goal of
is to find a model that can predict which future clients who would subscribe to the term
deposit. Having such an effective predictive model can help increase the campaign
efficiency as it would be possible to identify customers who would subscribe to the
term deposit and thereby direct  marketing efforts to them. This would help to
better manage resources (e.g human effort, phone calls, time)
The Bank therefore, collected a huge amount of data that includes
customers profiles of those who have to subscribe to term deposits and the ones who
did not subscribe to a term deposit. The goal is to to come up with a robust predictive model that would help
identify customers who would or would not subscribe to their term deposit in the
future.</p>
